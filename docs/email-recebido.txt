Dear Fabio M. Blanco,


while searching for an online C code editor, I found your ECCO project 
on sourceforge.net. At our institute we host several distance learning 
modules, some of which require the student to perform programming tasks 
in C.

That's why I'm interested in ECCO. Do you have a timescale for the 
availability of ECCO? Do you know of other online editors not focused 
on 
web development?

Thanks and best regards,

Attila Weyland

Dear Dr. Attila Weyland

We are at an early development stage of this project but we are working in a very strict schedule and will have a functional version at 15 august of this year. At october of this year we will have, for sure, a public release.
This is our graduation project and it must happen until the end of the year.

I dont know any similar projects with this specifications and I think this is the first one of this kind.

Hope our project can help you in the near future.

Goodbye
